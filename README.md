# actin-fragmentation-model
This repository contains the compiled Java application used to run the actin–ROS simulation described in the manuscript. The program implements the PDE model of actin polymerization, oxidation, filament severing, fragmentation, and diffusion.

Files included:
actin_frag_simulator.jar
README.txt

Running the program
The .jar file runs on its own and opens a graphical user interface. No input files are needed.
